# ReservationSystemTraining
Reservation system in java. Project written for skill practice. I tried to using .yaml for the very first time.

Plan:
-revide the code again
-divide one method to 3 layers
-comunicate with user only in main method
-change code for reading and writing to method and use it for read and write (work with .yaml file); multiple "mapping" is contrary to best practices
